== Creating a SOCKS proxy for DNS

https://ma.ttias.be/socks-proxy-linux-ssh-bypass-content-filters/

1. Create SSH Tunnel
You can pick any port, in this case using 1337
```
ssh -D 1337 -q -C -N user@proxyserver.example.com
```
Once you run that, ssh will stay in the foreground until you CTRL+C it. 


3. Configure Mozilla to use the SOCKS tunnel

In Firefox, go to Preferences > Advanced > Network and find the Connection settings. Change them as such:

a. SOCKS host:  localhost:1337
b. Proxy DNS when using SOCKS

Your DNS should forward through the SOCKS host and you can now get into your environment.
