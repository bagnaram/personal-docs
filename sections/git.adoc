== Git related things

=== Pulling and updating Submodules

To fetch the submodules:
----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

and now proceed updating them to latest master branch (for example):

----
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
----

You would like to squash them into a single commit but you already have a PR created with these separate commits. You can still squash them locally and push.

1. View Git log.

2. You want to select the commit hash that you would like things to be squashed into. In this case `bb96598`. Everything above it will squash into a single commit.
----
$ git rebase -i bb96598
----

3. You will enter an interactive tool to manage each commit in the rebase.
----

# Rebase 893a17f..dc024ff onto bb96598 (       20 TODO item(s))
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out

4. Modify each commit to squash, leaving the topmost one as the commit message:
----

5. You will likely have conflicts in the rebase process if there were any regressions.

error: could not apply 671f264... Added rhel7 back into imagestreams

When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".

Could not apply 671f264... Added rhel7 back into imagestreams Removed --openscap-html-report to address https://github.com/openshift/image-inspector/issues/105 Fixed bug in imagestream instead of direct Docker image
----

Run `git status` to see what file the conflict appears in.
----
# HEAD detached from bb96598
# You are currently rebasing branch 'master' on 'bb96598'.
#   (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
#   (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
#   (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

----

Edit the Unmerged paths file. In this case: `images/image-sign-scan-base/Dockerfile` Fix the file and save.

Run `git rebase --continue` until all the changes merge.
